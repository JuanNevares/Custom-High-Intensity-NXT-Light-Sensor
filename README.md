# Custom-High-Intensity-NXT-Light-Sensor
Materials for an Open Source, Custom High Intensity Light Sensor for the Lego NXT Mindstorms Platform. Original research start time was within Fall of 2013 at California State University, San Bernardino.

The original goal was to have the new sensor and materials become Open Source for the NXT Platform. Unfortunately, higher priorities had incremented over time, and so the project stagnated.

However, most of the materials are here, and should be available for use. Should there be comments or issues, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me. Appropriate changes will be done as soon as possible.
